# Our Solution Team-19: PRO_CODERS
🙂 Our team has put in tremendous efforts to discover a solution towards **"The Social Town"** wherein we tried to find out a solution in bridging the gap between Volunteers, Corporators and NGO's.

Our Web application, built using Django Framework along with FireBase 🔥, involves various features, which majorly include:
- Provide a single platform for Volunteers, Corporators and NGO's.
- Provide a Credit-based system for the top-performers who take part in maximum events. 🥇
- These credits add on to Company's profile, with top Company recognised to be maximum points. ✴️
- Enable Email notifications to intimate Volunteers about any events that are occuring. ✉️
- Allow NGO's to intimate their Volunteers about events on their dashboards based on match-making system.
